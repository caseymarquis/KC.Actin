Summary:
Directors are independent. They have no parents and no children.
Actors are dependent, and may have one parent or multiple children.

Let's consider an actual use case to see why this is:

We have an MDC server, a DNC server, and a series of deployed devices.
All of these are running directors which are capable of spawning
the actors which they know about.

The MDC director cares about spawning MDC actors on the devices.
The DNC director cares about spawning DNC actors on the devices.
The directors on the devices care about spawning the actors they 
need to run internally and get things done.

A Parent/Child relationship between directors fails here.
Both the MDC and DNC directors would each like to have child processes on
the device directors. Thus, each director should be awaiting orders
from trusted peers.

Directors should therefore be independent entities.
While individual actors maintain parent/child relationships, directors do not.
Thus, the location of an actor does not tell you where it fits in the dependency graph.
